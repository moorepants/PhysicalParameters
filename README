These are some tools for caluculating the physical parameters of a bicycle.

You will need this software to run the code (hopefully indpendent of the
version):
python 2.6.5
numpy 1.3.0
scipy 0.7.0
uncertainties 1.4.5

Download the data files from:

****will add this once I upload all the data files****

Then run these files sequentially:

1. fitData.py: Calculates the period of each moment of inertia oscillation
experiment.

2. torcom.py: This averages the periods and tries to format them a little better
for use in processData.py.

3. processData.py: This does all the calculations and outputs the data in some
text files.
