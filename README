These are some tools for calculating the physical parameters of a bicycle.

This was written and tested under Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

You will need this software to run the code (hopefully indpendent of the
version):
python 2.6.5 http://www.python.org
scipy 0.7.0 http://www.scipy.org
numpy 1.3.0 http://numpy.scipy.org
matplotlib 0.99.1.1 http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
uncertainties 1.4.5 http://pypi.python.org/pypi/uncertainties

Download the data files from:

http://mae.ucdavis.edu/~biosport/PhysicalParameters/data.tar.gz

I'll hopefully have this more user friendly in the future, but for now you can
run physical_parameters.py to run everything sequentially or run things
individually.

To run individually run these files sequentially:

1. fit_data.py: Calculates the period of each moment of inertia oscillation
experiment.

2. tor_com.py: This averages the periods and tries to format them a little better
for use in processData.py. (this should be combined with fitData.py)

3. calc_parameters.py: This does all the calculations and outputs the
parameters in text and pickled files.

4. calc_canon.py: calculates the benchmark canonical matrics for each bike

5. calc_JasonOnBikes.py: calculates the parameters and canonical matrics with a
rider on each bike (same position relative to the benchmark coordinates)

6. bike_eig.py: calculates eigenvalues and critical speeds for an upright
steady speed configuration, makes a couple of plots

7. bike_bode.py: makes bode plots of various SISO transfer functions
