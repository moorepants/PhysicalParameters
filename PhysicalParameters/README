These are some tools for calculating the physical parameters of a bicycle.

This was written and tested under Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

You will need this software to run the code (hopefully indpendent of the
version):
python 2.6.5 http://www.python.org
scipy 0.7.0 http://www.scipy.org
numpy 1.3.0 http://numpy.scipy.org
matplotlib 0.99.1.1 http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
uncertainties 1.5.3 http://pypi.python.org/pypi/uncertainties

Download the data files from (currently they are .mat files):

http://mae.ucdavis.edu/~biosport/PhysicalParameters/data.tar.gz

The python files should be in the top directory and their should be these
subdirectories:

/data -- put general data files here (data.mat and MeasUncert.txt)
/data/pendDat -- all the pendulum measurement .mat files go here
/tables
/plots

Run each of these functions in order to build the plots and tables:

1. mat2dic : converts all the raw data files into python pickled types

2. fit_data: Calculates the period of each moment of inertia oscillation
experiment. Takes a while.

3. tor_com: This averages the periods and tries to format them a little better.

4. calc_parameters: This does all the calculations and outputs the
parameters in text and pickled files.

5. calc_canon: calculates the benchmark canonical matrics for each bike, also
for a bike with rider and a bike with lower torso

6. bike_eig_plots: calculates eigenvalues and critical speeds for an upright
steady speed configuration, makes a couple of plots

7. bike_bode: makes bode plots of various SISO transfer functions

8. make_tables: makes tables of the results

To Do List
----------
- convert all the data files to either txt files or python types (.p, .npy,
  .npz)
- consolidate into one raw data file and one processed data file
- add more bode plots
- clean up the bode plots
- convert more things to functions
- seems to be a bug when trying to do bike_eig_plots of multiple types in a row
