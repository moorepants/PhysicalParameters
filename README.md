Description
-----------
This is code associated with the work done to measure the physical parameters
of a bicycle and the rider of a bicycle. Physical parameters include but are
not limited to the geometry, mass, mass location and mass distribution of the
bicycle rider system. More detail can be found in our papers and the
[website](http://biosport.ucdavis.edu/research-projects/bicycle/bicycle-parameter-measurement/).

Papers
-------------------
These papers detail the methods associated with the experiments and
calculations.

Modules
-------

- BicycleParameters : A module for calculating the physical parameters of a
  bicycle.
- HumanParameters : A yet to be module for calculating the physical parameters
  of a person (while seated on a bicycle). The functionality in paper [2] can
  be found in the matlab code in the PhysicalParameters directory.
- PhysicalParameters : Code used to write paper [1]. It works but is
  depreciated. Most of it is now in BicycleParameters and is much more user
  friendly.
